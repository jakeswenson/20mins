## Jumping Jack
- Stand with your feet together, core engaged, and hands at sides.
- Jump your feet wider than hip-width apart, and bring arms up to clap hands overhead.
- Jump your feet back together and bring your arms to your sides to return to starting position.
- Repeat as quickly as possible for 20 seconds, going for height and speed.
