- Lower into a forearm plank, starting with your left arm, followed by your right.
- Then, come up in the reverse orderâ€”starting with your right arm and following with the left.
- Now that you're back in the high plank, perform one frogger by jumping your feet outside your hands, keeping your weight in the center of your feet. Drop your butt down.
- Then, jump your feet back out to a high plank and repeat the plank-up starting with the right arm this time.
- If this is too challenging, scale down by doing the plank-up from your knees and walk your feet in for the frogger instead of jumping.
