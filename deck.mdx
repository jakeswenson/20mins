        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Stand with your feet together, core engaged, and hands at sides.</li>
                <li>Jump your feet wider than hip-width apart, and bring arms up to clap hands overhead.</li>
                <li>Jump your feet back together and bring your arms to your sides to return to starting position.</li>
                <li>Repeat as quickly as possible for 20 seconds, going for height and speed.</li>
            </ul>
